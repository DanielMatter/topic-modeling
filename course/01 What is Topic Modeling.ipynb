    "# What is Topic Modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is a method for unsupervised learning of the latent topics that occur in a collection of documents. It is a form of dimensionality reduction, in which the number of dimensions is reduced from the vocabulary of the documents to the number of topics. Topic modeling is a powerful tool for the discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. It is used for a variety of tasks, including document clustering, information retrieval, and recommender systems."
