    "LDA, like most classical topic models, understands words as distinct features of documents, where the appearances of words in documents are independent of each other, except for the topic-word distribution which the model learns.\n",
    "This assumption is not true in real life, where words are related to each other in a semantic way. For example, the words \"dog\" and \"cat\" are more similar than \"dog\" and \"apple\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, Embeddings-Based Topic Models (EBTM) can be understood as introducing a prior on the topic-word distribution, which is based on the pretrained semantic similarity between words. This prior is expressed as an additional layer of abstraction, where the topic-word distribution is a function of the word embeddings, instead of the word-counts themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to LDA, most EBTM models, hence, are not generative. Instead, they follow a bottom-up approach. First, documents are embedded in the new, semantic embedding space, and then, topics are extracted from the documents in this new space.\n"
